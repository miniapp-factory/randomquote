A stylized, colorful logo featuring a stylized quotation mark in the center of a bright, gradient background. The quotation mark is bold and slightly tilted, with a subtle shadow to give depth. The background gradient transitions from a warm orange at the top to a cool teal at the bottom, creating a vibrant, eye‑catching effect. The logo should be simple enough to be recognizable at small sizes, yet detailed enough to convey the idea of quotes and inspiration.
